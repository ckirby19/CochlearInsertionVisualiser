# CochlearInsertionVisualiser

This repo provides the models and scripts needed to visualise the curling process of a novel shape-memory polymer basedcochlear implant as it enters a cochlear.
The cochlear implant is modelled as a series of spring-mass-dampers which can be tuned to match real curling data from cohclear implant insertions.
